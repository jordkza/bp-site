          <h3>Make Dialogue Productive</h3>
          <p>Work consumes most of our days. Our ability to communicate with clarity, connection, purpose and empathy within the workspace <strong>largely determines our success</strong> and sense of well-being.</p>
          <p>Whether we engage one-on-one or in a team, or whether we lead organizations, effective communication paired with a deep capacity to listen enhances important relationships.</p>
          <p>Understanding your unique way of communicating and your colleagues' own styles keeps dialogue open. <strong>It could be your superpower</strong> in moments of pressure and conflict.</p>
          <p>Grow your communication skills and tools:</p>
          <ul class="star-list">
            <li>Understand your unique communication style</li>
            <li>Gain perspective on others' communication styles</li>
            <li>Work at mastering your typical triggers</li>
            <li>Learn techniques for handling areas outside of your comfort zone</li>
            <li>Develop the art of true listening and leadership skills</li>

      <h3>Speak Like You Were Born to Do It</h3>

      <p>Your <strong>voice and speech are powerful social tools</strong>; building blocks for effective communication. When you first meet someone they form an impression based on what they hear.</p>
      <p>Your voice can create clarity, convey vital information, and create connections. Yet it can also hold tension in the body, resistance, fear and judgment.</p>
      <p>The breath is the engine that makes your free voice soar. When you are breathing optimally, your voice resounds with ease and your words land with more clarity and connection.</p>
      <p>In coaching, I rarely speak to the voice and speech in isolation. I always will connect it to the breath and what is happening below the surface for you so that we can build a better whole.</p>
      <p>Together, we'll grow your authentic voice:</p>

      <ul class="star-list">
        <li>Increase your connection to your natural speaking voice</li>
        <li>Develop an open, resonant and free voice with breath support</li>
        <li>Improve your speech clarity and articulation</li>
        <li>Develop a natural vocal connection to listeners</li>
        <li>Grow your capacity for finding natural rhythm and pace</li>
      </ul>
